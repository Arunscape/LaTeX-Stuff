\section{Introduction}

The purpose of this document is to serve as an exercise in creating a career
plan, and setting some goals. As a part of this exercise, an initial career
plan was created. Then, three graduate engineers at varying stages in their
careers were interviewed. Finally, some similarities and differences in the
interviewees's  experiences were discussed, as well as some points raised which
were unexpected or surprising. These points were considered, and the career
plan was modified to mitigate any potential concerns which were raised after
the interviews.
