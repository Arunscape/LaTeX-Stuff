\section{(Initial) Career Plan}

\subsection{Industry}

report}, 
I expressed interest in the Artificial Intelligence, or AI industry, and at the
time of writing this report, it remains an area of interest for me. 


\subsection{Ultimate goal and how to get there}
The ultimate career goal is obviously to get to a financially stable state,
living comfortable, and being able to afford luxuries. There are many ways to
get there, and several books claiming to share some `secret', however, the
general trend appears to be that these books tend to help the authors reach
their financial goals instead of the reader. A more pragmatic approach should be
taken which acknowledges the existence of uncertainty in the real world. 

The first thing that should be acknowledged when making an initial career plan
is that I have little experience. So, the first step should be to get in touch
with experienced individuals, and ask for their advice. Luckily, that is the
purpose of this report, so the first step is already done.

The next thing to think about would be what I plan to do after graduation.
At this point, there are many areas in the software engineering field that I 
have not experienced yet. Even though I think that right now Artificial
Intelligence might be interesting, I might find out later that I find another
area to be more interesting. There is no way to figure that out without first
trying, so the plan for immediately after grduation is to try out working for
different companies in different areas in the software engineering field. 
The idea is to spend 1-2 years at various companies, and switch when it is
natural. For example, if I plan to move to a different city, or an exciting
opportunity arises. Doing this would also have the benefit of easily building
my network for people, and making that network as diverse as possible.
