\section{Job Search Plan}

\subsection{Preparation}
An essential prerequisite for job hunting is a good resume. The plan here is to
keep it up to date, and keep track of accomplishments continuously. Even when I
find myself in a comfortable position, I should remind myself to update my
resume say, once every 6 months just to keep track of accomplishments. 

\subsection{Research and Networking}
Another important thing to keep and maintain is my network. As part of the job searching
plan, I would reach out to a few people in my network. I would let them know I
am currently open for opportunities, and for those willing, I would ask for a
resume review.
