\section{Introduction}
The purpose of this document is to serve as an introduction to the Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists Code of Ethics \cite{apegacode}.
From this point forth in the document, the Association of Proffestional Engineers and Geoscientists Code of Ethics will be referred to by its acronym: APEGA.
In the following paragraphs, we will be analyzing a real ethical dilemma, and relating it to APEGA's Code of Ethics.
As the talking points discussed may be sensitive, the names of relevant parties and employers involved have been modified to ensure that confidentiality is maintained.
Fun fact: Maintining confidentiality is part of Rule 3 in Section 4.3.3, and will be further explored in this report.

geoscientist when making ethical decisions
