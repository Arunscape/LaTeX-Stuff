\section{Introduction}
The purpose of this document is to serve as an introduction to the Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists Code of Ethics \cite{apegacode}.
From this point forth in the document, the Association of Proffestional Engineers and Geoscientists Code of Ethics will be referred to by its acronym: APEGA.
In the following paragraphs, we will be analyzing a real ethical dilemma, and relating it to APEGA's Code of Ethics.
As the talking points discussed may be sensitive, the names of relevant parties and employers involved have been modified to ensure that confidentiality is maintained.
Fun fact: Maintining confidentiality is part of Rule 3 in Section 4.3.3 in the AEGA Code of Ethics, and will be further explored in this report.
There are 5 main rules one must consider in the APEGA Code of Ethics:
\begin{enumerate}
    \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
    \setlength{\parskip}{0pt}
    \setlength{\parsep}{0pt} 
    \item Health, Safety \& Welfare of the Public
    \item Competence and Knowledge
    \item Integrity, Honesty, Fairness, and Objectivity
    \item Statutes. Regulations, Bylaws
    \item Honour, Dignity, and Reputation
\end{enumerate}

\section{The Situation}
A professional engineer whom we will be referring to as \textit{Kowalski} is currently working for ABC Company.
Recently, Kowalski received a job offer from XYZ Company, which is ABC Company's main competitor. As it turns out,
the offer is a good one, and he would like to accept the offer. Initially, Kowalski thought he could not take 
the job on, because he was not sure if he signed an agreement with ABC Company that limited his ability to work for the
competitor for a period of time. Luckily for Kowalski, no such agreement was made, so he is free to work for XYZ Company.
However, in his new position, Kowalski finds himself challenged with a few ethical dilemmas where there is no clear solution.
Fortunately, the APEGA Code of Ethics exists, and can be used to aid with his decision making process.

\section{Conclusion}
As we can see, while the Code of Ethics is clearly defined, there are situations which arise that must be considered carefully by an engineer or
geoscientist when making ethical decisions
