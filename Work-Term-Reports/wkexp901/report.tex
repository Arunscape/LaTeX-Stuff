\section{Overview}

\#introduce the organization
ATB Financial, or Alberta Treasury Branches is a financial institution in Alberta, Canada.
Established in 1938, ATB Financial is a crown corporation with 50.7 billion dollars in assets.\cite{annualreport2018}
ATB has over five thousand team members who support the one hundred and seventy-five branches, one hundred and forty-two
agencies, three Entrepreneur Centeres, a Customer Care Centre, and mobile and onine banking.
These services serve over seven hundred and forty thousand customers. \cite{annualreport2017, annualreport2018}

ATB Financial has a rich work culture. (maybe the 11 ATBs part fit in better somewhere else.)
I joined ATB Financial through its ATB 101 program, with about XXX\cite{} number of students

\#explain what you do
I am a developer working on the future ATB Online for Business Website.
The transformation team makes up a large part of the ATB organization. Its purpose is to ``reimagine banking''.
Specifically, I'm a part of the digital transformation team. When one thinks of a bank,
programming is not usually in the list of things that comes to mind. However, technology
plays a huge role in today's world of banking, and online banking is one of the many
aspects of banking in the digital world today.

1.	Provide an overview of the organization currently employing you. Include the following:
•	Size and purpose of the organization
•	Products and services provided and markets served
•	Where in the organization your area/department fits, its role and responsibilities
•	Your role in your department and in the organization

\section{Learning Opportunities}

In the short time I have had working so far for ATB Financial, the organization has presented
countless exciting challenges and learning opportunities.
From day one, I was put outside of my comfort zone, presented with the challenge of
getting accustomed to a new operating system. Having seldomly used macOS before,
there was a bit of a learning curve. Even though macOS is designed to be ``user friendly'',
there are some nuances to get used to coming from a Linux or Windows environment.
As soon as compliance training was over, I was given the opportunity to take online
courses for almost two weeks to familiarize myself with the technologies that I am
working with now. I took refresher courses on JavaScript, and then learned
about creating web applications using React and Redux. React is a JavaScript framework developed by Facebook,
which enables the creation of web UI with reusable components\cite{react}, and Redux is a state container
for JavaScript apps\cite{redux} which works nicely with React. While coding at ATB,
I have learned to program and organize my code in ways that are simply not taught in traditional
classes.

\section{Work Preferences}

\begin{enumerate}
 \item prefer management style similar to ATB where trust is given
 \item I like the challenges given by ATB, where everyday I'm learning something new and I hope
       to always continue learning
 \item I like the hands off management style where you are responsible for showing up to work on time, keep track of your hours,
       and take breaks when you should
 \item I'm in computer engineering, I don't see myself working in a plant or out in the field surveying anytime soon.
\end{enumerate}

3.	Based on this information, provide an analysis of your work preferences, which can help you in deciding the direction of your future work terms. Discuss your preferences regarding:
•	Style of management/supervision
•	Type and nature of tasks
•	Level of responsibility
•	Work environment (field, plant, or office) and location
