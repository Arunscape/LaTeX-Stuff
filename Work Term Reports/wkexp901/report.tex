ATB is an organization with over 5000 employees \cite{annualreport2017} which provides various financial services mainly to Albertans.
I am a developer working on the future ATB Online for Business Website.

\section{Work Preferences}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item prefer management style similar to ATB where trust is given
  \item I like the challenges given by ATB, where everyday I'm learning something new and I hope
        to always continue learning
  \item I like the hands off management style where you are responsible for showing up to work on time, keep track of your hours,
        and take breaks when you should
  \item I'm in computer engineering, I don't see myself working in a plant or out in the field surveying anytime soon.
\end{enumerate}
