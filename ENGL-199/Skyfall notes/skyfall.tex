    Bond exits his car and goes in the building to follow the murderer, with his gun drawn.

    from underneath. Man in elevator hears bond hanging below and draws his gun.
    He exits elevator and bond climbs up. Room has a lot of glass. Bond walks stealthily around
    and the man he's after is unlocking some brfiefcase and breaking into something by cutting glass
    or using a computer or something
    . Music builds up.
    Man readies some assult rifle looking thing, bond still approaches.
    Yes he was cutting a hole in the glass.
    The man looks like he is an asssassin, and the hole was for him to
    snipe someone
    Bond engages after the sniper shot has been fired. This is a man on man fight.
    He asks the assassin who has the list as he's hanging off the side of the building.
    The assassing chooses to let go and suicide, and bond makes eye contact with the woman in
    the other building across where a guy was shot. Bond picked up some token and looks at it.

    to be the black woman. They talk again, and bond is mocked for shaving the old fashioned way.
    (The super sharp barber knife) And then he asks the black woman to help him out.
    She jokingly says something along the lines of "you're puttin g your lie in my hands again"
    "old dog, new tricks"

    Bond goes to some private event, at a csino. Bond cashes in the token he found from the
    assassin. Bond makes eye contact with same woman he saw in the other building.

    it must be special. The woman he made eye contact with approaches bond,
    and asks him for a drink. They go for a drink, and the woman asks if she can ask
    a "buisiness question that has to do with death". She asks why he killed batrise or something like that.
    Bond replies I wan to be your employer if I heard that correctly. She excuses herself,
    but bond stops her and observes that she has 3 bodyguards and that she is "being controlled" not being protected,
    and also notices some mark on her hand.
