% Letter body

Moore's Law is coming to an end due to the
physical size of the silicon atom, which will limit the size of transistors in semiconductor chips.
Without the ability to make smaller, more %power
efficient transistors such that we can fit more transistors in the same area as previous generations
of microprocessors, computers cannot be made faster while maintaining the same form as we know them today.
This means that, unless research is done to find other suitable semiconductors for making smaller transistors
, we will hit a wall in computing where we are limited by processing speed of our computers.
Right now, carbon nanotubes may seem as a promising material for semiconductors, being very small and conductive,
but for the most part, carbon nanotubes grown from solids other than carbon (especially semiconductors)
are too fragile for practical use. However, gallium nitride (GaN), which is already known for its
fantastic semiconductor properties seems to be showing promise, given that it is already used in many
industrial and military applications. Datacenters are reducing their
power consumption right now by using power supplies which use GaN to convert voltages more efficiently, and
Raytheon (a defense contractor company) makes radar systems which use GaN.


Currently, the main reason we are not seeing GaN being used in consumer electronics is the


% I believe Gallium Nitride would be a great material to research for the fabrication of next
% generation semiconductor chips.


% As you might have heard,
% GaN is proven to have desireable qualities for the construction of transistors.
% It has many advantages over silicon, which is what is widely being used right now in
% the fabrication of consumer semiconductor chips, There are others working on using
% While there is research currently with using carbon nanotubes, we are seeing results now with Gallium nitride
% The main reason we are not switching over from silicon to this amazing material is the cost of fabrication.
Part of my reasearch will be on how to lower manufacturing costs of GaN



Furthermore, it was originally developed for military radar chips.

This is an assignment for an English class. Therefore, it is not a real research proposal letter, and some 'facts' presented
may not be correct, since some sources may not be reliable, or due to my misinterpretation of graduate-level articles.
