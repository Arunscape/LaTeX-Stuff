\begin{abstract}
 Video games are often blamed for many social problems, from laziness and lack of motivation to accomplish anything, to pent up aggression that gets released as acts of violence in the real world. Although the gameplay in the Mass Effect Series contains violence, by allowing the player to develop his/her own character, the narrative of the game causes players to think about societal issues such as inter-alien racism, and to resolve these issues in a civil manner.

The narrative takes place in the future, where humans are no longer concerned about racism amonsgt themselves but rather societal
tensions are between alien races. (If anything there are ideological tensions ie. with cerberus and the alliance but these
tensions are not a result of racism amonsgt humans, but rather different ideological views of what is the best interest for the human race. (cerberus believes in using any methods (even illegal and terrorist like) for furthuring the human race.)
both organizations goals are to ultimately do what they believe is best for the entire human race). Rather, racial tensions are observed betweeen different alien races.

\section{Introduction}
Although video games are commonly criticized for promoting aggression, and desensitising indivuduals, Mass Effect touches on some very important societal issues today, and makes the player think about political views,
and what stance they should pick. One of the prevalent issues in the world today is racism. In Mass Effect 3, the issue of racism is portrayed through alien characters, and tensions between them. The narrative takes place in the future, where humans are no longer concerned about racism amonsgt themselves. The ultimate goal of the game is to make (sometimes difficult) decisions as a representative for humanity which resolve tensions and unite the races against a common threat -the Reapers.

The Reapers are advanced synthetic life forms, which perform a purge of all intelligent organic life every 50,000 years, which is known as a `harvest'. They were made to preserve organic life, since
(within the Mass Effect universe), intelligent lifeforms, once advanced
enough to develop technological advancements ultimately make synthetic
lifeforms which rebel and destroy against their organic creators. Ironically,
the solution to this problem for the Reapers is to harvest the genetic makeup
of the galaxy, and allow new civilizations to grow and be harvested in a continuous cycle. The goal is to unite the intelligent
races in the Milky Way Galaxy against the Reapers, and break the cycle.
However, the races must work together to do so,
and previous history tells that every previous cycle was
unsuccessful due to unresolved conflicts between the intelligent races. The game puts the player in the position to make important decisions as a leader to unite the races through diplomacy, and to ultimately be the saviour of all organic life in the Milky Way Galaxy.

\section{Human conflict - Cerberus Terrorist organization}
Body paragraphs: Start with the concession , then continue with arguments supporting your opinion
The allied aliens work together in a sort of galactic united nations-like government comprised of the most powerful sentient species, called the Council. Citadel. Cerberus throws in a monkey wrench and claim to be pro human,
but in reality are extremists who even illegally experiment on humans,
and ruthlessly kill those who do not agree with their ideology

-Renegade and paragon statistic most people chose to be a good leader as opposed to a ruthless one.
\textit{``Cerberus is a human-survivalist paramilitary group led by the enigmatic Illusive Man. Cerberus' core belief is that humans deserve a greater role in the galactic community, and that the Systems Alliance is too hamstrung by law and public opinion to stand up effectively to the other Citadel races. Cerberus supports the principle that any methods of advancing humanity's ascension are entirely justified, including illegal or dangerous experimentation, terrorist activities, sabotage and assassination. Cerberus operatives accept that these methods are brutal, but believe history will vindicate them. Nevertheless, both the Systems Alliance and the Citadel Council have declared Cerberus to be a terrorist organization and will prosecute identified Cerberus agents accordingly. ''\cite{wikia}
}
The player's goal is to unite the aliens against the reapers, as
previous civilizations have failed due to one species dominating the others.


\textit{``The greatest threat in the game then is not so much the Reapers, but the xenophobic prohuman faction called Cerberus who seek to use Reaper technology to impose human dominance over the galaxy. The explicitly racist undertones of Cereberus’ spokesman, the Illusive Man (voiced by Martin Sheen), contrasts Shepard’s multiculturalist project.''\cite{chrisb}

however, it should be noted that even if the player chooses to be a ruthless leader, the intentions are still for the greater good of the universe - to save
all life from the threat of reapers.

\section{Tensions Between The Krogan and the Salarians}
these alien races distrust each other because one developed a virus to wipe the
other out. A staggering 92\% of the players choose to cure the genophage, which
eases diplomatic tensions, and is considered the good option. -and also,
only 3.8\% shot Mordin, a

\end{figure}
which is generally considered the ``good'' thing to do, since the Krogan have suffered due to this disease brought on them by the Salarians.
...this means that even a large portion of the 35.5\% who chose
to be a ruthless leader still found value in the diplomatic implications
of righting a wrong from the past, even if the mistake was not a cause
of the human race. Furthurmore, in an emotional moment where the Commander is
presented with the choice to shoot Mordin, a young scientist who is dedicated
to fixing the Genophage, only 4\% actually shot Mordin, even though shooting him would gain the military support of the Salarians. Even for the ruthless players, most of them could not justify shooting such an admirable character.
%Reason 3
\section{Are A.I. as important as Organic Life?}
The Quarians, who developed machines called the geth to do work made these
machines more advanced, and in violation of the Citadel's rules these machines
become a fully blown self-aware Artificial intelligence. The Quarians attempt to wipe them out, but the geth retaliate, and the Quarians lose millions of people, and are now nomads, and lose representation on the Citadel.
The player chooses between saving the Quarians, or gaining the military support of the geth, who have free will.

Ultimately, at the end of the game, the player chooses between destorying
all synthetic life, taking control of it, or merging organic and synthetic life,
thus reaching the ``pinnacle of evolution''\cite{me}
