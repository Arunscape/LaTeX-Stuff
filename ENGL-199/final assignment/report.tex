\begin{abstract}
 Video games are often blamed for many social problems, from laziness and lack of motivation to accomplish anything, to pent up aggression that gets released as acts of violence in the real world. Although the gameplay in the Mass Effect Series contains violence, by allowing the player to develop his/her own character, the narrative of the game causes players to think about societal issues that we have problems with today, and act as a leader for the galaxy.

%Introduction
\section{Introduction}
\textit{This introduction is far from complete, and only has ideas jotted down}
Although video games are commonly blamed for aggression in society today,
and the desensitising of indivisuals with respect to serious societal issues, Mass Effect  touches on some very important societal issues today, and
makes the player think about political views. One of the prevalent issues in the world today is
racism. Particularly, In the Mass Effect 3, the issue of racism is portrayed through alien characters, and
tensions between them, where the player makes decisions literally as a world leader. The game puts the player in the position to
make important decisions, which impact the outcome at the end of the game, and good decisions are rewarded.

The narrative takes place in the future, where humans are no longer concerned about racism amonsgt themselves but rather societal
tensions are between alien races. (If anything there are ideological tensions ie. with cerberus and the alliance but these
tensions are not a result of racism amonsgt humans, but rather different ideological views of what is the best interest for the human race. (cerberus believes in using any methods (even illegal and terrorist like) for furthuring the human race.)
both organizations goals are to ultimately do what they believe is best for the entire human race). Rather, racial tensions are observed betweeen different alien races.

\section{Are A.I. as important as Organic Life?}
The Quarians, who developed machines called the geth to do work made these
machines more advanced, and in violation of the Citadel's rules these machines
become a fully blows self-aware Artificial intelligence. The Quarians attempt to wipe them out, but the geth retaliate, and the Quarians lose millions of people, and are now nomads, and lose representation on the Citadel.
The player chooses between saving the Quarians, or gaining the military support of the geth, who have free will.
