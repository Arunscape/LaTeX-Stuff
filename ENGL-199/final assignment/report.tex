\begin{abstract}
 Video games are often blamed for many social problems, from laziness and lack of motivation to accomplish anything, to pent up aggression that gets released as acts of violence in the real world. Although the gameplay in the Mass Effect Series contains violence, by allowing the player to develop his/her own character, the narrative of the game causes players to think about societal issues such as inter-alien racism, and to resolve these issues in a civil manner.

\section{Introduction}
Although video games are commonly criticized for promoting aggression, and desensitising indivuduals, Mass Effect touches on some very important societal issues today, by making the player think about political views,
and what stances they should pick. One of the prevalent issues in the world today is racism. In Mass Effect 3, the issue of racism is portrayed through alien characters, and tensions between them. The narrative takes place in the future, where humans are no longer concerned about racism amonsgt themselves. The ultimate goal of the game is to make (sometimes difficult) decisions as a representative for humanity which resolve tensions and unite the races against a common threat -the Reapers.

The Reapers are advanced synthetic life forms, which perform a purge of all intelligent organic life every 50,000 years in the Milky Way, which is known as a `harvest'. They were made to preserve organic life, since
(within the Mass Effect universe), intelligent lifeforms, once advanced
enough to develop technological advancements ultimately make synthetic
lifeforms which rebel and destroy their organic creators. Ironically,
the solution to this problem for the Reapers is to harvest the genetic makeup
of the galaxy, and allow new civilizations to grow and be harvested in a continuous cycle. The goal is to unite the intelligent
races in the Milky Way Galaxy against the Reapers, and break the cycle.
However, the races must work together to do so,
and previous history tells that every previous cycle was
unsuccessful due to unresolved conflicts between the intelligent races, resulting in a lack of cooperation. The game puts the player in the position of Commander Shepard (male or female), who is tasked with making important decisions as a leader to unite the races using diplomacy, and to ultimately be the saviour of all organic life in the Milky Way Galaxy.

\section{Extremist Views - Cerberus Terrorist organization}
% \textit{Body paragraphs: Start with the concession , then continue with arguments supporting your opinion}
Although the primary goal in Mass Effect 3 is to unite the alien races, some
extremist views are presented, which the player can choose to side
with ideologically to some extent. Cerberus, led by the Illusive Man is
a xenophobic prohuman paramilitary group \cite{chrisb}\cite{wikia}
who believe that earth's government, the Systems Alliance is too
worried about law, and public opinion to stand up to other Citadel races.
The Citadel is a United Nations like coalition of the intelligent races in the Milky Way. Cerberus believes that ``any methods of advancing humanity's ascension are entirely justified, including illegal or dangerous experimentation, terrorist activities, sabotage and assassination.''\cite{wikia}
Cerberus's claim that it promotes the rights of humans, despite being
essentially a hate group for other aliens is strikingly similar to
extremists today, who also engage in illegal activities
to promote their agendas.
% Opportunities are presented to the player to agree with some of the
% Illusive Man's actions.
One of
Cerberus's main goals is to control Reaper technology to gain a technological
advantage for humans. However, the means for doing so are widely regarded as unacceptable. At one point in the narrative, it is found that Cerberus
had been running a ``Sanctuary'', wherin people seeking
shelter from the Reapers were taken in and used as human test subjects
subject to torture and premature death. Commander Shepard is given the opportunity to agree with the Illusive Man that the Reapers should be controlled, but if the player so chooses, the Illusive Man denies.
It can be noted that the wrecklessness of the experiments run by Cerberus
appear to be analagous the type of human experimentation run in
Nazi Germany, having to do with amputations, physical and mental trauma, and mutations.

Although the player is given the option to agree with the Illusive Man that Reapers should
be controlled instead of destroyed, Commander
Shepard does not join sides with Cerberus, since his goal is to save life.
Therefore, while the player is exposed to extremist views in the game,
it is made abundantly clear through storytelling and causing the player to feel
emotions such as disgust, and sympathy for the victims that the actions taken by Cerberus are morally wrong. The game shows that the end does not necessarily justify
the means, even if the player goes with the Renegade, or ruthless playing style
as a leader.


\section{Renegade and Paragon Playing Styles}
Throughout Mass Effect 3, the choices given to the player often fall into one
of two categories: Renegade and Paragon. The Renegade and Paragon system in
Mass Effect allows players to choose from one of two main playing styles.
The Paragon options typically have to do with showing compassion, or charming someone while Renegade choices are typically used for intimidation or coercion.
In this way, the game differentiates good choices of ``good'' and ``bad'',
with both options having positive and/or negative consequences.
Some would argue that the system, which allows players to choose Renegade options reinforces negative behaviours such as insulting people and/or intimidation. The game, in this regard allows the player to define their political views with regard to religion, views on other alien races,
and sexuality, with Renegade options tending to be less tolerant with views
regarding some races, or religion.
In contrast, players who choose Paragon options tend to solve issues by being more open and friendly to non playable characters. Fortunately, according to
statistics for Mass Effect 3 compiled in 2013 \cite{ea}, most players choose
to be a kind leader by making Paragon choices, which shows that the emotions
developed in the narrative generally make the player feel like they should
do the right thing.

\begin{figure}[h!]
 \includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{paragon}
 \caption{Most players choose on their own accord to be a kind leader as opposed to a ruthless one who gets the job done. \cite{ea}}
\end{figure}

As for the 35.5\% who chose the Renegade playing style, it should be noted that even if the player chooses to be a ruthless leader, the result of the player's actions are still for the greater good of the universe, which is saving
all life in the Milky Way from the threat of reapers. Furthermore, when choosing Renegade options, the player often sees the results of their actions,
which in some cases results in emotional responses from players who may
``regret'' an action.

\section{Tensions Between The Krogan and the Salarians}
these alien races distrust each other because one developed a virus to wipe the
other out. A staggering 92\% of the players choose to cure the genophage, which
eases diplomatic tensions, and is considered the good option. -and also,

\end{figure}
which is generally considered the ``good'' thing to do, since the Krogan have suffered due to this disease brought on them by the Salarians.
...this means that even a large portion of the 35.5\% who chose
to be a ruthless leader still found value in the diplomatic implications
of righting a wrong from the past, even if the mistake was not a cause
of the human race. Furthermore, in an emotional moment where the Commander is
presented with the choice to shoot Mordin, a young scientist who is dedicated
to fixing the Genophage, only 4\% actually shot Mordin, even though shooting him would gain the military support of the Salarians. Even for the ruthless players, most of them could not justify shooting such an admirable character.
%Reason 3
% \section{Are A.I. as important as Organic Life?}
% The Quarians, who developed machines called the geth to do work made these
% machines more advanced, and in violation of the Citadel's rules these machines
% become a fully blown self-aware Artificial intelligence. The Quarians attempt to wipe them out, but the geth retaliate, and the Quarians lose millions of people, and are now nomads, and lose representation on the Citadel.
% The player chooses between saving the Quarians, or gaining the military support of the geth, who have free will.

% Ultimately, at the end of the game, the player chooses between destorying
% all synthetic life, taking control of it, or merging organic and synthetic life,
% thus reaching the ``pinnacle of evolution''\cite{me}
