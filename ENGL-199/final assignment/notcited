 abstract = { Canadian video game developer BioWare’s critically
acclaimed Mass Effect video game series has been called the most
important science fiction universe of a generation. Whether or not one
is inclined to agree, it cannot be denied that Mass Effect matters. It
matters not only because of its brilliant narrative and the difficult
questions it asks, but also because, as bioethicist Kyle Munkittrick
writes, it reflects society as a whole. Mass Effect is a sci-fi epic in
the truest sense, spanning over years and across hundreds of planets
tucked away in the darkest corners of the galaxy, populated with dozens
of species with their own histories, beliefs, cultures, and
technologies. Academics and dedicated fans have explored the numerous
facets of the game, from its philosophy to time and temporality, fandom
ethnographies, and ethics. This article proposes to explore the
boundaries of alien sex and the desire for alien others as represented
in sci-fi role playing games, and their reinterpretation by fans.
Science fiction role playing games in particular enable the production
of sexual modalities outside of the constraints of heterosexual norms.
Alien sex, animal sex, or monstrous sex are common tropes in fantasy and
sci-fi media—the vampire, the werewolf, and monstrous non/in-humans are
eroticized and construed conduits of a mainly female sexual desire.
However, the example I would like to approach is slightly more radical,
both in terms of execution and in terms of media audience response:
examples of “alien sex” as illustrated in the Mass Effect video game
series, whose canonical representation of alien-human romances invite
some interesting questions about either the potential exacerbation, or
the rendering-unintelligible of sexual difference, as well as about
cross-species desire and about the ontology of the natural and the
artificial. }

 abstract = { This article discusses the role of historicity in the Mass Effect series of videogames. In a preliminary moment, I will attempt to identify the concepts that underline the franchise’s notion of history. Subsequently, I will discuss ways to analyze such a portrayal from the point of view of its audience’s response and its potential as a platform for historical reflection. Finally, I will compare Mass Effect’s approach to history with that of the retro-futuristic Bioshock games as well as with the discussions about historical strategy games made by historians to determine convergences and dissonance in their employments of historical discourses. It will be argued that Mass Effect’s choice-based narrative conditions its notion of history as an individually driven process whose changes are manifested in the short duration and that its hypothetical future is consonant with some of contemporaneity’s anxieties about its place in history }

 abstract = { According to cognitive psychologists, moral decision-making is a dual-process phenomenon involving two types of cognitive processes: explicit reasoning and implicit intuition. Moral development involves training and integrating both types of cognitive processes through a mix of instruction, practice, and reflection. Serious games are an ideal platform for this kind of moral training, as they provide safe spaces for exploring difficult moral problems and practicing the skills necessary to resolve them. In this article, we present Morality Play, a model for the design of serious games for ethical expertise development based on the Integrative Ethical Education framework from moral psychology and the Lens of the Toy model for serious game design. }

 abstract = { This article looks at three narratological concepts—focalization, granularity, and the mode of narration—and explores how these concepts apply to games. It is shown how these concepts can be used as tools for creating meaning-effects, which are understood here as cognitive responses from the player. Focalization is shown to have a hybrid form in games. This article also explores the different types of narrators and granularities in games, and how these three concepts can be used to create meaning-effects. This is done by discussing examples from several games, for example, Assassin’s Creed III, Skyrim, Fallout: New Vegas, and Civilization. }

 abstract = { In recent years, the idea of player control, or agency, has become central and explicit in certain video games and genres, affecting many debates concerning the study or definitions of video games. In spite of this, the notion of agency in video games has been rarely explicitly explored or defined in relation to its sociological and political dimensions. Hence, drawing on actor–network theory, (neo-)Foucauldian governmentality studies, and empirical data gathered over a 3-year period, this article expands to our understanding of video game player agency and, moreover, argues that video games provide an important example and perspective to consider the contemporary nature and political basis of agency. }
