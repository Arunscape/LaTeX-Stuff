the robots are indistinguishable from humans, except they can't show emotions, but later on, they might be able to

Other stuff you know from the future

Mass Effect

key features:
omni tool is a floating magic computer on your wrist, is a melee weapon too
a new element called eezo (element zero) discovered, allows warping of mass for levitation and some
other things
"Element Zero, also known as "eezo", is a rare material that, when subjected to an electrical current, releases dark energy which can be manipulated into a mass effect field, raising or lowering the mass of all objects within that field. A positive current increases mass, a negative current decreases it. This "mass effect" is used in countless ways, from generating artificial gravity to manufacturing high-strength construction materials. It is most prominently used to enable faster-than-light space travel without causing time dilation."


humans work with other aliens, and fight other aliens

There is an etical debate with whether synthetic life should be treated the same as biological life,
since an alien race called the quarians created the geth, and they had a massive war, but
in the plot for mass effect 3, the geth show willingness to work with the humans in order to fight the 
reapers, a robotic force which wipes out all biological life every billions of years, in a purge
like manner
