  \section{March 7, looking at scene 9}


  \begin{itemize}
    \item Roy Bety is the most advanced ai. He talks to Leon.
    \item They go into some researcher's lab (Chu) who works on making eyes for the ais
    \item They interrogate him to find a man called sebastian
  \end{itemize}

  Here's what the prof says after pausing the movie
  The ai are superior to the humans in many ways
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Roy Baty - strength
  \item Leon - super strong
  \item They are not affected by the cold like Chu in the lab
  \item Leon puts his hand in the beaker of cryogenic liquid and is not affected by the cold
  \item He tears chu's jacket with ease
  \item Roy Baty is more intelligent than the person designing the machine eyes
  \item Roy Baty mentions 'fire at the angel's hell' - He seems to have a knowledge of literature
  \item Roy is efficient with his words/language
  \item The nexus have a 4 year lifespan because the humans who designed the ai were worried
        about the ai developing emotions. The ai come back to earch from a space colony because they
        want to meet their Maker. (J.F. Sebastian can take them to Tyrell)
\end{enumerate}

Next scene
J.F. Sebastian, the builder
\begin{itemize}
  \item Roy comes to sebastian
  \item Robots kiss
  \item roy shows emotion and concern there's only 2 of us now
        'We're stupid and we're gonna die'
  \item Sebastian seems like he will help them
  \item Roy makes Sebastian beat Tyrell at chess
\end{itemize}
Prof pauses movie
He tells them that he cannot extend their lifespan
Roy crushes tyrell's eyes and kills him
