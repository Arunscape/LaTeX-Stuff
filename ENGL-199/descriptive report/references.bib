Talking notes:​

​

Zero Emissions:​

-Tesla cars don’t use gas, they use electricity, it’s the main reason everyone’s hyped about EV’s​

-Electricity is relatively easy to clean up after. You don’t have to deal with disasters like oil spills.​

​

“Refining Gas Uses More Electricity Than Electric Cars”​

-But wait generating electricity has a carbon footprint!​

Yes, it does. However, refining gas actually uses more electricity than refining gas.  In a video interview with Elon Musk, an American Documentary filmmaker named Chris Paine mentions that it takes​

“4 to 6 kilowatt hours of electricity to refine every gallon of gasoline”, not including transportation costs. Elon Musk reinforces that statement saying that​

​

“You take an average of 5 kilowatt hours to refine gasoline, something like the Model S can go 20 miles on 5 kilowatt hours. You basically have the energy needed to power electric vehicles if you stop refining. “ –Elon​

Aluminum vs steel​

The Tesla Model S has an aluminum frame, and the Model 3 uses an aluminum alloy.​

Aluminum may be more expensive than steel. But, in the long run it’s better, because aluminum is very light compared to other metals. This makes cars overall lighter, which in turn means that less energy is needed to actually move, which is what cars are made to do. ​

​

“A fleet of aluminum vehicles saves the equivalent of 44 million tons of CO2 emissions.”​

​

Electric motors vs gas motors graph (Lotus, so high end cars)​

​

Electric induction motors, produce significantly more torque than an internal combustion engines due to their design.​

And as we know, torque is the force we need to turn the wheels in a car.​

​

A traditional gas engine needs to actually be running at a certain amount of revolutions per minute before it can even provide torque.​

Not only that, there is a delay before it reaches its maximum torque, which gets smoked by the amount of torque an electric engine can provide, starting from rest​

​

Additionally, Electric engines are extremely efficient. A good combustion engine can be 30-45% efficient​

But an electric engine can be 90% and even up to 98% efficient​
