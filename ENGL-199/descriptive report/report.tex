  %Talking about price
  One might think that a Tesla vehicle would be expensive, given the many
  features a Tesla car has to offer. While the recently announced Tesla Roadster
  has a base price close to a quarter million\cite{teslaroadster}, one may be
  surprised with Tesla's other consumer offerings, namely the flagship Model S sedan, Model X SUV,
  and the newer, more affordable Model 3. I recommend the Model 3 for the average person,
  given its more budget-friendly price point, with all the characteristic features
  one would expect from a Tesla vehicle.

  \section{Autopilot}
  Autopilot is one of the first amazing features you may notice about Tesla vehicles.
  Currently, all vehicles in production by Tesla have sufficient hardware to be able to
  drive without any user input. Tesla even claims that their cars are capable of driving
  at a safety level ``substantially greater'' than a human driver\cite{allcarsautopilot}.
