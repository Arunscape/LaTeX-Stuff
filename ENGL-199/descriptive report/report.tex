  %Talking about Autopilot
  %Talking about price
  One might think that a Tesla vehicle would be expensive, given the many
  features a Tesla car has to offer. While the recently announced Tesla Roadster
  has a base price close to a quarter million\cite{teslaroadster}, one may be
  surprised with Tesla's other consumer offerings, specifically the Model 3.
  I recommend the Model 3 for the average person,
  given its more budget-friendly price point, with all the characteristic features
  one would expect from a Tesla vehicle.

  \section{Autopilot}
  Autopilot is one of the first amazing features you may notice about Tesla vehicles,
  offering both convenience and safety. Currently, all vehicles in production by Tesla
  have sufficient hardware and software to drive without any human interaction.
  A Tesla car is able can be summoned with the click of a button, predict where you're
  going without you telling it, know that it should stop en route to charge if needed,
  and park itself without any user input. Tesla even claims that their cars are capable of driving
  at a safety level ``substantially greater'' than a human driver\cite{allcarsautopilot}.
  Tesla is able to accomplish this by including eight cameras, twelve ultrasonic sensors, and a front radar
  sensor which all work together to monitor the area around the car. It is not hard
  to see why Tesla makes such bold claims about how effective its Autopilot system is,
  because a mere human is physically incapable of constantly keeping track of the area around
  the car he is driving. A human needs to divide his attention between looking forward,
  checking the blind spot when changing lanes or parking, among other things one would typically
  look out for when driving. In contrast, a computer is able to monitor everything
  around the car simultaneously. The ultrasonic and radar sensors
  provide information to the computer for sensing objects, that a human cannot
  detect with his natural senses. For example, the radar sensor is very useful when
  there is thick fog that a camera or human cannot see through. The computer, powered
  by the powerful NVIDIA DRIVE PX 2 chip uses machine learning to improve driving for
  thousands of users every day. Other companies like GM have to test their autonomous
  driving systems with fleets monitored by their own employees, while Tesla collects
  real-world data (with consent) from its users and processes the data with machine
  learning to constantly push new updates and features to improve the autonomous
  driving experience.

  The amount of real-world data Tesla has, combined with its sensors which can
  detect danger faster than a human can react\cite{predictcrash} makes Tesla's
  autonomous driving system the most reliable on the market for consumers today.

  \section{Price}
  Price is a concern for most who are in the market for a new vehicle. Upon seeing
  all the features a Tesla car has to offer, one might think that surely,
  such a futuristic vehicle must cost a pretty penny. While Tesla does have
  more luxurious offerings like the Roadster and Model S, I would argue that the
  Tesla Model 3 is ideal for most users, starting at \$35 000 USD.\@ This advertised
  price might seem deceptive until you consider that it is common practice
  in the auto industry to advertise a starting price, while most of the models available
  are sold at a premium of a few thousand dollars more expensive than the base model. The
  Tesla Model 3 is no exception here, with a maxed out model costing about
  \$59 000 USD\cite{maxprice}. A sensible configuration, however, need not
  be so pricey.
