  %Talking about price
  One might think that a Tesla vehicle would be expensive, given the many
  features a Tesla car has to offer. While the recently announced Tesla Roadster
  has a base price close to a quarter million\cite{teslaroadster}, one may be
  surprised with Tesla's other consumer offerings, namely the flagship Model S sedan, Model X SUV,
  and the newer, more affordable Model 3. I recommend the Model 3 for the average person,
  given its more budget-friendly price point, with all the characteristic features
  one would expect from a Tesla vehicle.

  \section{Autopilot}
  Autopilot is one of the first amazing features you may notice about Tesla vehicles.
  Currently, all vehicles in production by Tesla have sufficient hardware and software to
  drive without any user input. Tesla even claims that their cars are capable of driving
  at a safety level ``substantially greater'' than a human driver\cite{allcarsautopilot}.
  Tesla is able to accomplish this by including eight cameras, twelve ultrasonic sensors, and a front radar
  sensor which all work together to monitor the area around the car. It is not hard
  to see why Tesla makes such bold claims about how effective its Autopilot system is,
  because a mere human is physically incapable of constantly keeping track of the area around
  the car he is driving. A human needs to divide his attention between looking forward,
  checking his blind spot when changing lanes, among other things one would typically
  look out for when driving. In contrast, a computer is able to monitor everything
  around the car simultaneously. Additionally, the ultrasonic and radar sensors
  provide more information to the computer for sensing objects, that a human cannot
  detect with his natural senses. For example, the radar sensor is very useful when
  there is thick fog that a camera or human cannot see through. The computer, powered
  by the powerful NVIDIA DRIVE PX 2 chip uses machine learning to improve driving for
  thousands of users every day. Other companies like GM have to test their autonomous
  driving systems with fleets monitored by their own employees, while Tesla collects
  real-world data (with consent) from its users and processes the data with machine
  learning to constantly push new updates and features to improve the autonomous
  driving experience.
